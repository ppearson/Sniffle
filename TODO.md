Sniffle TODO:
-------------

* Multithread file finding
* Multithread content searching
* Progressive content searching as files are found
* Outputting line numbers
* Outputting before content context lines
* Outputting file size / file date along with filename
* More flexible and advanced file/directory pattern matching
* File filtering (size, date)
* Use faster content-searching (Boyer-Moore), finding newlines after initial match
* Count mode
* More flexible output mode (built-in as opposed to piped to stdout), allowing outputting
  to multiple files based off file location subdirectory
